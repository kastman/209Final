    "First, this notebook builds a table of the questions asked, in order, on each year of the ACS (colnames.csv). With some human elbow-grease, this becomes colnames_final.csv which has one row per question and one column per year; each entry is the name given to that question in that year. colnams_final.csv can be used to map the as-written names to the \"official\" name: the name used the final year that question was asked."
